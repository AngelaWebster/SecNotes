dangerous malware that typically encrypts systems unless victim pays attacker. usually bitcoin
once this happens, its impossible for someonne to get their stuff back. 

the encryption is usually on the disk itself.

attakcs:
  the main thing is how it can get in and what forms it takes
  phishing that downloads and executes the malware
  insider threat downloading / plugging it in
defense:
  preventive:
    awareness of threat. training on not to click sus stuff
    malware scanners if its already on the system
    IDS/IPS if its traveling to the victim. will alert admin or discard traffic
  backup:
    if ransomware occurs, have a backup of the system thats compromised. make sure its one that doesnt have the malware.
    dont let backups get infected or you're screwed.
