cyber sec doesnt apply to just networks. if someone breaks in physically and steals stuff, thats bad.

attack:
  walking into the server room
  theft of property or data
  harm to people or equipment
  shoulder surfing
  plugging in something to a system physically
    keyloggers
    malware / backdoor - could emit a signal
    unauthorized wifi hotspot plugged in.
defense:
  vestibules - one door cant open while the other is open. prevents tailgaiting
  locked doors
  codes on doors or card scanners
  cameras
  guards
  escorting visitors
